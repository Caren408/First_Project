Exploratory data analysis: Generate insight of movie genres for Microsoft

Introduction

Problem Statement
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

By observing the prevailing box office performance, we can gain valuable insights into audience preferences and tailor our movie production strategy accordingly. These insights will guide decision-making processes.
